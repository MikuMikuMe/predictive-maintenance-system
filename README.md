# predictive-maintenance-system

Creating a complete predictive maintenance system using machine learning is a complex task that involves several steps including data collection, data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. Below is a simplified example of how you might develop such a system in Python. This example assumes you have a dataset containing sensor data and failure events, which is commonly available in industrial IoT setups.

```python
# Import required libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score
import joblib
import logging

# Configure logging

### Key Points

1. **Data Handling**: Includes loading and preprocessing the data. Missing values are handled using forward fill. Adjust preprocessing based on specific data characteristics.

2. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Uses a RandomForest classifier, which is robust for tabular data. Evaluation metrics are printed and logged.

3. **Error Handling**: Includes try-except blocks to catch exceptions during data processing, model training, and other critical steps.

4. **Logging**: Comprehensively logs the process to a file to help troubleshoot issues.

5. **Model Saving**: Uses `joblib` to serialize and save the trained model to disk.

Please note that building a real-world predictive maintenance system involves more detailed data engineering, feature selection/engineering, model tuning, validation on unseen data, potential integration with IoT platforms, and possibly using more advanced models or time-series analysis.
